# ADR006 Open Source Solution

## Title
Open Source Solution

## Status
Proposed

## Context
As part of the Wildlife.ai project's commitment to fostering collaboration and accelerating wildlife conservation efforts, a decision needs to be made regarding making the entire solution, including the wildlife cameras and the mobile app, an open source solutoin. This move aligns with the ethos of transparency, community involvement, and enabling a broader impact on conservation efforts.

## Decision
We propose to make the entire Wildlife.ai solution open source, encompassing both the wildlife cameras and the mobile app. This decision is driven by the desire to encourage collaboration, engage the community, and contribute to the collective knowledge and efforts in wildlife conservation. In addition, this could accelerate development and enhancements to the solution.

## Rationale
1. **Community Collaboration**: Opening up the solution invites contributions from a diverse community, including wildlife enthusiasts, researchers, and developers, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.
2. **Transparency and Trust**: Providing transparency by open-sourcing the solution builds trust among users, partners, and the wider community, reinforcing Wildlife.ai's commitment to ethical wildlife conservation practices.
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Open sourcing the solution facilitates knowledge sharing, allowing others to learn, contribute, and potentially enhance the solution for various use cases and environments.


## Implementation Details
The implementation will involve establishing public repositories for both the wildlife cameras and the mobile app on a platform like GitHub. Documentation, including setup guides and contribution guidelines, will be provided to encourage and facilitate community involvement.

## Benefits
- **Community Engagement**: Encourages collaboration and involvement from a wider community.
