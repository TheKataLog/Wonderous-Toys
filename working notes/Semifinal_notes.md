# TIPS from second view
## Tell a compelling story
## Make sure your solution reflects architecture characteristics
## Properly justify your ADR
## Representation consistency in diagrams
How the images relate to each other - consistent drawings
They like the jedi's diagrams
Also the Mijagis diagrams
Consistent color coding
2 judges like the structure + serial numbering

# Judges criteria
## Clarity of narrative, organization, and supporting documentation
Intellige and coherent
People need to understand your submission
### Why is more important than the how. Focus on business content.
Narrative is background, constraint, 
Organization, Can I find date. Use a table of contents. How easy is to navigate/y.
Supporting documentation. A newbie needs to understand
### Identification of supporting architecture characteristics
Use the worksheet Mark provided, the Architecture Style Worksheet. We didn't use them...
They want to show the mapping between ADR and arch characteristis. Mapping characteristics to requirements! TABLE
Also REFERENCE Characteristics
### Understanding requirements and completeness of solution
Demostrate a clear distillatoin of the problem. 
Identify assumption and implications
Connect architecture
Outline and target fundamental functional and technical challenges
### Diagrams - types, level of detail, completeness
Think beyond architecture diagrams
Legends
Distint colors
Arrows should be pointing the right directions
Easier to read in diagrams
### ADR
Use the communication patterns book
Link to things you are using
Implication (trade offs)
Consulation at the end with other people
ADR to decide which template for ADRs to use...
Add diagrams into ADRs to help clarify it
REFERENCE ADRs
Link to ADRs in different part of the solution

* Wildlife Watchers
* AnimAI (maybe https://github.com/plmsprd/AnimAI)

# Templates
We could create ADRs to explain why we use each of them

kata as an example as it is easy to organize our thoughts and solutions in an easy way.

as a go-by. Its all draw.io symbols and we are keeping the blue / orange color scheme
