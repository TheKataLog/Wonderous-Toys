### Problem Space Overview	[1]

1. **Data Capture:**
   - Deploy the camera in the desired location to capture information (images/videos) about the species residing in that area.

2. **Data Analysis, Sharing, and Conservation:**
   - Analyze the collected data to derive insights.
   - Share the data with third-party services to contribute to a global impact and foster community building.
   - Contribute to species conservation efforts by collaborating with relevant organizations and initiatives.

3. **Middleware Solution:**
   Develop a solution that acts as a <strong>middleware</strong> enabling users to store and seamlessly share data captured by the camera with other interested third-party services.


### Challenges [2]

1. **Open-Source AI Camera for Conservation:**
   - Wildlife AI wants to develop an open-source camera embedded with artificial intelligence for species conservation efforts.

2. **Software Solution Complexity:**
   - The proposed software solution acts as an add-on to the open-source camera.
   - Both the camera and software are open-source, accommodating users with diverse technical expertise levels.

3. **Audience Variability:**
   - Designing a solution that caters to diverse audiences, from tech-savvy to non-technical users, presents a significant challenge.


### Proposal [3]

In aiming for an open-source solution, we've outlined key characteristics: 

- **Simplicity:**
  - Design the solution to be easily understandable by diverse audiences (modularity).

- **Feasibility:**
  - Ensure cost-effectiveness to accommodate users with and without budget constraints.

- **Adaptability through Modular Design:**
  - Build the solution with the capability to transition into standalone services, facilitating future scalability for the intended user base.
