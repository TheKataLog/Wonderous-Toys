- How would data make it out of the camera?
- If it is only hundrers users, could it be thousands of cameras?
- Is it preferred to centralize control of the cameras at wildlife.ai?
- Does real time health mean ? Is it knowing about the species being identified, or video uploaded, or camera heartbeat (e.g. running out of battery, space)?
- Are there any preferences on running on public, private, on premise or hybrid?
