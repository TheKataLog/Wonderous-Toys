- How would data make it out of the camera?
- If it is only hundrers users, could it be thousands of cameras?
- Is it preferred to centralize control of the cameras at wildlife.ai?
- Does real time health mean ? Is it knowing about the species being identified, or video uploaded, or camera heartbeat (e.g. running out of battery, space)?
- Are there any preferences on running on public, private, on premise or hybrid?
- Are there preferences about data availability?
- Do you own the Weta Watcher? Are we assuming this is the camera? (At the end of the presenataion, Neal said they hadn't decided on the camera, we can influence that if we like)
- Ok to say that is there is enough b/w, the camera can upload videos? To where? (Note: none of the docs ever mention WiFi on the camera, we have assumed that)
- Do we consider people making their own cameras, do we need to consider onboarding them?
